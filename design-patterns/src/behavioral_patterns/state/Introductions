Intent: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

Applicability: Use the State pattern in either of the following cases

an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at run-time depending on that state

operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object's state. 
This state is usually represented by one or more enumerated constants. 
Often, several operations will contain this same conditional structure.
 The State pattern puts each branch of the conditional in a separate class. 
 This lets you treat the object's state as an object in its own right that can vary independently from other objects.
 
 意图：允许一个对象来改变它的行为时，其内部状态的变化。对象将会出现改变它的类。

适用范围：使用状态模式在以下任一情况下，

对象的行为取决于它的状态，并且它必须改变其行为在运行时根据该状态

操作都依赖于对象的状态大，多部分条件语句。
这种状态通常是由一个或多个列举的常量来表示。
通常情况下，几个操作将包含此相同的条件结构。
 State模式放条件的每个分支在一个单独的类。
 这可以让你把对象的状态本身就是一个对象，它可以从其他对象独立地变化。
